## 📌 What is MediTrack+?

**MediTrack+** is a mobile app that reminds users to take their medicines — and if they forget, it notifies their caretakers.

Built for:
- 👴 Elderly parents who always say “I’ll take it later”... and don’t.
- 😅 People like me (and maybe you?) who forget even reminders.
- 👩‍⚕️ Caretakers who want peace of mind — without having to call 5 times a day.

## 🧠 Why MediTrack+?

Because **"Set a reminder"** isn’t always enough.

We built MediTrack+ to be:
- **Simple** enough for grandparents to use  
- **Smart** enough to know when reminders are ignored  
- **Supportive** enough to include caretakers in the loop
